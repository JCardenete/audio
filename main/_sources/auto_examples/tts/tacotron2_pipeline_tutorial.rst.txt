Text-to-speech with torchaudio Tacotron2
========================================

Overview
--------

This tutorial shows how to build text-to-speech pipeline, using the
pretrained Tacotron2 in torchaudio.

The text-to-speech pipeline goes as follows:

1. Text preprocessing

   First, the input text is encoded into a list of symbols. In this
   tutorial, we will use English characters and phonemes as the symbols.

2. Spectrogram generation

   From the encoded text, a spectrogram is generated. We use ``Tacotron2``
   model for this.

3. Time-domain conversion

   The last step is converting the spectrogram into the waveform. The
   process to generate speech from spectrogram is also called Vocoder.
   In this tutorial, three different vocoders are used,
   `WaveRNN <https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/models/wavernn.html>`__,
   `Griffin-Lim <https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/transforms.html#griffinlim>`__,
   and
   `Nvidia's WaveGlow <https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_tacotron2/>`__.


The following figure illustrates the whole process.

.. image:: https://download.pytorch.org/torchaudio/tutorial-assets/tacotron2_tts_pipeline.png

All the related components are bundled in :py:func:`torchaudio.pipelines.Tacotron2TTSBundle`,
but this tutorial will also cover the process under the hood.

Preparation
-----------

First, we install the necessary dependencies. In addition to
``torchaudio``, ``DeepPhonemizer`` is required to perform phoneme-based
encoding.

Text Processing
---------------


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 83-101

Character-based encoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, we will go through how the character-based encoding
works.

Since the pre-trained Tacotron2 model expects specific set of symbol
tables, the same functionalities available in ``torchaudio``. This
section is more for the explanation of the basis of encoding.

Firstly, we define the set of symbols. For example, we can use
``'_-!\'(),.:;? abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'``. Then, we will map the
each character of the input text into the index of the corresponding
symbol in the table.

The following is an example of such processing. In the example, symbols
that are not in the table are ignored.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 101-114

.. code-block:: default


    symbols = '_-!\'(),.:;? abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    look_up = {s: i for i, s in enumerate(symbols)}
    symbols = set(symbols)

    def text_to_sequence(text):
      text = text.lower()
      return [look_up[s] for s in text if s in symbols]

    text = "Hello world! Text to speech!"
    print(text_to_sequence(text))

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 115-120

As mentioned in the above, the symbol table and indices must match
what the pretrained Tacotron2 model expects. ``torchaudio`` provides the
transform along with the pretrained model. For example, you can
instantiate and use such transform as follow.

The ``processor`` object takes either a text or list of texts as inputs.
When a list of texts are provided, the returned ``lengths`` variable
represents the valid length of each processed tokens in the output
batch.

Phoneme-based encoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Phoneme-based encoding is similar to character-based encoding, but it
uses a symbol table based on phonemes and a G2P (Grapheme-to-Phoneme)
model.

The detail of the G2P model is out of scope of this tutorial, we will
just look at what the conversion looks like.

Similar to the case of character-based encoding, the encoding process is
expected to match what a pretrained Tacotron2 model is trained on.
``torchaudio`` has an interface to create the process.

The following code illustrates how to make and use the process. Behind
the scene, a G2P model is created using ``DeepPhonemizer`` package, and
the pretrained weights published by the author of ``DeepPhonemizer`` is
fetched.

Spectrogram Generation
----------------------

``Tacotron2`` is the model we use to generate spectrogram from the
encoded text. For the detail of the model, please refer to `the
paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05884>`__.

It is easy to instantiate a Tacotron2 model with pretrained weight,
however, note that the input to Tacotron2 models need to be processed
by the matching text processor.

:py:func:`torchaudio.pipelines.Tacotron2TTSBundle` bundles the matching
models and processors together so that it is easy to create the pipeline.

For the available bundles, and its usage, please refer to :py:mod:`torchaudio.pipelines`.

Waveglow
~~~~~~~~

Waveglow is a vocoder published by Nvidia. The pretrained weight is
publishe on Torch Hub. One can instantiate the model using ``torch.hub``
module.
